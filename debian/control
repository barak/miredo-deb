Description: Teredo IPv6 tunneling through NATs
 The Teredo IPv6 tunneling protocol encapsulates IPv6 packets into UDP/IPv4
 datagrams, to allow hosts behind NAT devices to access the IPv6 Internet.
 .
 Miredo is a Teredo client (as per RFC 4380): it can provide IPv6
 connectivity to a dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 host even if it is located behind a
 NAT. It can also operate as a Teredo relay which forwards IPv6 packets
 between the IPv6 Internet and remote Teredo clients.

Description: Teredo IPv6 tunneling server
 The Teredo IPv6 tunneling protocol encapsulates IPv6 packets into UDP/IPv4
 datagrams, to allow hosts behind NAT devices to access the IPv6 Internet.
 .
 Miredo-server provides a Teredo server. Teredo servers help Teredo clients
 determine their NAT configuration, maintain their NAT binding, and perform
 hole punching when transmitting IPv6 packets to other Teredo clients and/or
 Teredo relays.
